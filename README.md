# :fire: Code with Hades :fire:

:wave: Hello! My name is Hades and I welcome you to my GitHub's corner!

:confounded: As a Java developer I have faced many problems that required research and many times all I could find were snippets of code without any context or documentation.

:rocket: This is why I bring you specific, documented and fully working examples of the most common Java scenarios

* Spring Boot
    * [How to set it up with the basics](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-basic-setup)
    * [Deploy a simple REST API](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-rest-api)
    * [Actuators for metrics and health checks](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-actuators)
* Quarkus
    * _Under construction_

:pray: I hope you find them useful in times of need, and if you want to support me in my mission to help our fellow Java developers please consider sponsoring this space.

:coffee: May Java be with you!
