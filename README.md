# :fire: Code with Hades :fire:

:wave: Hello! My name is Hades and I welcome you to my GitHub's corner!

:confounded: As a Java developer I have faced many problems that required research and many times all I could find were snippets of code without any context or documentation.

:rocket: This is why I bring you specific, documented and fully working examples of the most common Java scenarios

* Spring Boot
  * [How to set it up with the basics](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-basic-setup)
  * [Deploy a simple REST API](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-rest-api)
  * [Actuator for metrics and health checks](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-actuator)

  * [How to configure profiles](https://github.com/codewithhades/spring-boot-profiles)
